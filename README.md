# Beach Obsurfer

A **28h Hackathon** project developed remotely during the Web Development course at _Wild Code School - Lisbon_ by **Arnaud Duhé**, **Filipa Marta** and **Isadora Hillebrand**.
You can check our project live here (at Netlify):[Link](https://heuristic-babbage-442cdb.netlify.app/)

#### The Idea

We received “Travel from the sofa” and two API’s as a briefing. After brainstorm, our decision was to make a COVID19-friendly digital platform to keep the population updated about social/weather conditions of the best beaches in Portugal by giving the opportunity to observe them throughout webcams (live mode). Our app also offered the chance to “web travel” and relax without leaving home. To do so, we chose **Windy API https://api.windy.com/**. We named our project: _Beach Obsurfer_.

#### The Development

We draw two wireframes: Homepage and Detail page. We setup the GitHub environment using Git and an organization account with two branches: master (blocked for commits) and develop. To build the project we used Netlify. We setup a Trello board with Scrum and defined the boilerplate for the project with React, Bootstrap, SASS, HTML, React Router, Google fonts. We used Visual Code Studio to write the code and for visual interface design, Sketch. To prepare the presentation we used Google Slides. Everything in this project was made remotely through Google Hangouts meetings.

#### Our Role

We worked together on the brainstorm, wireframes, setup the GitHub and Trello environment. We worked together on the set up of the React App as well as main major components to do the MVP (minimal viable product) to GET the information from the API. Then we split the coding part between “user stories”. Arnaud Duhé worked on the Search bar and on the Modal to show the search results. Filipa Marta worked on the pages Router and on the Loader. Isadora Hillebrand worked on the Footer, on the Modal to show the search results and the final presentation. Web design and general style of the application was managed by Filipa. We worked all together remotely, taking doubts, discussing ideas and being there to one another when Git came into stage. Together we presented our project to Brussels, Bucarest and Lisbon campuses and on April 30th, 2020.
